# reportTool
An automated reporting tool made to collect data and create a concise report

# Description
Created a software on Python that generates a PowerPoint report. Taking a folder directory from the user, the program scans through all subfolders and text files for data (multiple variables). Subsequently, this data is used to create a table and multiple graphs for each text file (2 slides per file), making up a full PowerPoint presentation report. The report is then sent to a recipientâ€™s email address. Choosing the folder directory and entering email address are done through a fully developed GUI window.
